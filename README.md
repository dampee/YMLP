# YMLP

## Project Description
Yourmailinglist.Com offers a API, but has no native .Net implementation. This project offers a helper class supplying strongly typed method calls. 

## What is Ymlp
It stands for YourMailingListProvider.Com.  Ymlp.com provides an online e-mail newsletter system.  This project aims at .Net developers using YMLP and connecting to the API.  

## Install via nuget 

    Install-Package Prompt.YmlpApi

## Create free account
You can [create an account for free](http://ymlp.com?a=NXV1HS) and use the API at no costs.

It was ported from the PHP version of the API library as described in [this blogpost](http://blog.dampee.be/post.aspx?id=48b857fb-246f-4b4e-b5a0-2c572c9b5bb6).
